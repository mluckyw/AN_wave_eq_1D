This MatLab code are made for Homogenous Wave Equations Problems
The modes in this codes are: Plotting and Calculating the positions of equations,
With plotting variation on time and fourier order
Further optimization and range addition could be conducted with more time
The program made by M.Lucky W - 13617113
The program will be beneficial for faster system analsys
 
This programs runs on the equations of: 
U(X,T) = X(x)T(t)
u(x,t) = Cn Un (x,t) = sigma Cn sin(n pi x / L) cos(n pi A t / L)
With Cn of (2/L)Integral[L to 0] f(x) sin(n phi x / L) dx at specified sections
The following are the input required by the program

A variable: 2
Step along the string(Cm): 1
The following are for initial Conditions Input
How many Initial conditions on the string (IC=>1): 2
1 Section separation 
Section point of separation: 10
1 Initial Condition 
Initial conditon is a polynominal with fuction of X? yes(1),no(0): 1
Power of the equation: 1
Input the variables from the highest power to lowest power: 0.1
Input the variables from the highest power to lowest power: 0
The equation for initial conditions are: 
x/10
 
2 Initial Condition 
Initial conditon is a polynominal with fuction of X? yes(1),no(0): 1
Power of the equation: 1
Input the variables from the highest power to lowest power: -1/20
Input the variables from the highest power to lowest power: 1.5
The equation for initial conditions are: 
3/2 - x/20
 
The following are the initial conditions based on user input: 
[ x/10, 3/2 - x/20]
 
How many order of the fourier series that want to be analyzed(n): 3
Please input with the current order value are smaller than the next
1 order input 
Order value (n>1): 1
2 order input 
Order value (n>1): 3
3 order input 
Order value (n>1): 5
The value of CN:  
(90*sin((pi*n)/3) - 180*cos((pi*n)/3)^2*sin((pi*n)/3) + 30*n*pi*cos((pi*n)/3))/(15*n^2*pi^2) + (30*sin((pi*n)/3) - 10*n*pi*cos((pi*n)/3))/(5*n^2*pi^2)
 
Below are the general Solution equations: 
sin((pi*n*x)/30)*cos((pi*n*t*x)/15)*((90*sin((pi*n)/3) - 180*cos((pi*n)/3)^2*sin((pi*n)/3) + 30*n*pi*cos((pi*n)/3))/(15*n^2*pi^2) + (30*sin((pi*n)/3) - 10*n*pi*cos((pi*n)/3))/(5*n^2*pi^2))
 
How many time want to be analyzed: 3
1 Time input 
Time value: : 0
2 Time input 
Time value: : 25
3 Time input 
Time value: : 75
The program are currently calculating, Please wait
The time are depending on how many order are analyzed
Categorized plotting by time(1) or order(2): 1
